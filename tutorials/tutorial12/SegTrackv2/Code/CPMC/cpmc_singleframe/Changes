5th October

- Added missing overlap.c file.

2nd November

- Fixed lines 142-144 of cpmc(). When number of segments was smaller than dimensionality of first cell of features, it crashed.
Noticed and contributed by Jasper Uijlings.

9th November

- Added missing cartprod_mex.c file.

10th February

- Fixed semi-serious bug in SegmentProcessor.m
There was a problem filtering segments using the cut ratio. It was removing the wrong segments.

13th February

- Code can now run in 32-bits linux. The changes required were contributed by Andreas Mueller. Thanks Andreas!
Also added his two mex files overlap_care.c and my_phog_desc_mex.c.

- Added a script for recompiling mex files (compile.m).
Some files use OMP and require the user to set the path to matlab in a Makefile which is now provided in code/.
