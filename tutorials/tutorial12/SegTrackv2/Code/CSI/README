In Windows, mex assign_superpix.cpp should be sufficient to compile the file assign_superpix.cpp, with a modern Visual Studio such as 2010. 

However in linux with gcc, one should run "make" from the command line to compile the mex file. 
The main reason is that an additional flag -std=c++0x is needed since the code uses C++03 standard.
